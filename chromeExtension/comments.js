    "title": "North Korea's nukes are not the only weapon in its arsenal",
    "body": "As US intelligence keep providing evidence of North Korea's stunning acceleration of its nuclear program, experts say there is another weapon in Pyongyang's arsenal that the world should also keep a close eye on.\n\nKim Jong Un's military has been collecting large stockpiles of nerve agents such as sarin and VX, that could target U.S. military bases in the region and large cities like Seoul and Tokyo, according to a new report.\n\n\"Nuclear weapons are not the only threat,\" Kelsey Davenport, direction of non-proliferation policy for the Arms Control Association told the McClatchy Washington Bureau. \"North Korea could respond to a U.S. attack using chemical weapons. That would be devastating.\"\n\nWhile Pyongyang official denies that it possesses chemical weapons, the country started developing chemical weapons in 1961 amid rising tensions at the time.\n\nThe Korea Research Institute of Chemical Technology reports that the country has four military bases equipped with chemical weapons and at least 11 facilities where they are produced and stored.\n\nDavenport said it would be difficult, if not impossible, to neutralize North Korea's chemical weapon stockpile with a preventive strike.\n\n\"Compared to the nuclear threat, which involves, a finite number of warheads and delivery systems vulnerable to air defenses and antimissile systems, the chemical threat is not as easily negated,\" military analyst Reid Kirby wrote in the Bulletin of Atomic Scientists.\n\nThe report of Pyongyang's chemical arsenal comes amid rising tensions with the United States which saw an apparent de-escalation this week after North Korean media reported Kim had delayed a decision about whether to follow through with his threat to fire missiles toward Guam.\n\nPresident Trump said in a tweet on Wednesday that the dictator made a \"wise decision\" to back down from his threats.\n\n\"The alternative would have been both catastrophic and unacceptable!\" the president wrote.\n\nUS military officials have not commented on North Korea's chemical weapons arsenal.\n\nVX and sarin are two potent nerve agents, which attack the nervous system. Both have banned by the Chemical Weapons Convention, but several countries maintain stockpiles.\n\nTrump accused the Syrian government of using chemical weapons on its citizens earlier this year that killed at least 74 people.\n\n\"There is legitimate concerns that sustained use of chemical weapons in Syria has lowered the threshold for their use elsewhere,\" Davenport said.",
