- Use issues / PRs
- .sass-cache could be removed and then gitignored (ditto for the bundle stuff in chrome extension)
- Edit readme
- Dead code is bad for you! It is dead
- Would recommend bulma as a dependency (potentially as your own github fork of bulma)
- For the chrome extension use node_modules + package.json instead of "dependencies" folder
- Consider using react for your chrome extension
- Short term: security hole for oauth in chrome extension; long term: research it
